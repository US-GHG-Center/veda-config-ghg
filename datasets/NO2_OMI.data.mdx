    Surface methane (CH₄) emissions are derived from atmospheric measurements of methane and its ¹³C carbon isotope content. Different sources of methane contain different ratios of the two stable isotopologues, ¹²CH₄ and ¹³CH₄. This makes normally indistinguishable collocated sources of methane, say from agriculture and oil and gas exploration, distinguishable. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) collects whole air samples from its global cooperative network of flasks (https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/about.html), which are then analyzed for methane and other trace gases. A subset of those flasks are also analyzed for ¹³C of methane in collaboration with the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado Boulder. The ground and airborne CH₄ and ¹³CH₄ data used to optimize the methane emissions for CarbonTracker-CH₄ are publicly available by [Lan et al. 2023](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/arc/?id=166). 
    
    Scientists at NOAA and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) used those measurements of methane and ¹³C of methane in conjunction with a model of atmospheric circulation to estimate emissions of methane separated by three source types, microbial, fossil and pyrogenic. Microbial emissions are produced by microbial decomposition of present-day organic matter, such as in wetlands, agricultural fields, livestock and landfills. Fossil emissions come from the breakdown of ancient carbonaceous matter deep underground, such as natural gas, coal bed methane, and small amounts of naturally occurring geologic seeps. Finally, pyrogenic emissions come from the burning of present-day organic matter, such as from wildfires and biofuels. These three sources of methane come with slightly different ¹³C content, and therefore can be separated given enough atmospheric measurements. This dataset presents monthly methane emissions from microbial, fossil and pyrogenic sources, along with a layer of total methane emissions from all three sources combined, at 1° resolution from 1998 to 2021.

    ## Data Preparation
    The dataset undergoes rigorous processing:
    Raw measurements are adjusted for cloud cover and surface reflectivity.
    Validation is performed using ground-based observations like those from the EPA’s monitoring stations.
    Preprocessing includes unit conversions (e.g., Dobson Units to mol/m²) and spatial averaging for usability.
