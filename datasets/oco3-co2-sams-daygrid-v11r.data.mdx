    The [Orbiting Carbon Observatory-3](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/orbiting-carbon-observatory-3-oco-3), or OCO-3, is deployed on the International Space Station (ISS) and designed to investigate fundamental questions about the distribution of carbon dioxide (CO₂) and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) on Earth as it relates to uptake by the natural biosphere and oceans, growing urban populations and changing patterns of fossil fuel combustion. OCO-3’s Snapshot Area Mapping (SAM) mode is an unique mode of operation that allows OCO-3 to quickly scan large areas (80 km x 80 km) and collect data over specific targets, like urban areas and megacities, improving our ability to better quantify and study localized sources of CO₂ emissions. OCO-3 SAM mode observations are unique and currently no other instrument (ground-based or space-based) in the world takes these types of measurements. Since the beginning of the mission, OCO-3 has collected over 22,000 SAMs across the globe over a variety of targets, such as megacities, volcanoes and biospheric hotspots. These data are available from August 2019 – November 2023. From November 2023 to July 2024, OCO-3 was in storage to let another NASA payload complete its nominal mission on the ISS. OCO-3 was reinstalled and resumed science operations and SAM data collection from July 16, 2024.

    ## Scientific Details
    The [Orbiting Carbon Observatory-3](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/orbiting-carbon-observatory-3-oco-3), or OCO-3, is deployed on the International Space Station (ISS) and designed to investigate fundamental questions about the distribution of carbon dioxide (CO₂) and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) on Earth as it relates to uptake by the natural biosphere and oceans, growing urban populations and changing patterns of fossil fuel combustion. OCO-3’s Snapshot Area Mapping (SAM) mode is an unique mode of operation that allows OCO-3 to quickly scan large areas (80 km x 80 km) and collect data over specific targets, like urban areas and megacities. This is made possible by an agile 2-D pointing mechanism, called a Pointing Mirror Assembly (PMA), that allows for rapid transitions in pointing. The PMA is used to collect SAMs to sample emission sources and gradients, areas where plants and crops are being studied, volcanos, and other local carbon sources from space. The PMA also allows for target mode observations, similar to those taken by OCO-2, typically at Total Column Carbon Observation Network (TCCON) ground sites, that are then used in validation. OCO-3 SAM mode observations are unique, providing key observations to support the monitoring and understanding of changes to Earth’s surface and atmosphere. Currently no other instrument (ground-based or space-based) in the world takes these types of measurements.
