        "caption":"Biodiverse ecosystems need protection. Through fieldwork, coordination with local partners, and satellite observations, NASA and the Smithsonian are working hard to protect them. After years of forest loss, chimpanzee habitats are recovering. This is, in part, due to a collaboration between NASA and the Jane Goodall Institute (JGI). Using NASA Earth science satellite and other data, the Goodall Institute puts data into the hands of local communities to drive conservation across Africa's equatorial forest belt.  The Scimitar-horned oryx was marked from extinct in the wild to endangered in the wild thanks to the Smithsonian's work with partners to re-introduce the species to part of its original range in Chad. After successful breeding through the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, scientists are now monitoring nearly every oryx via GPS-tracking collars.  "
