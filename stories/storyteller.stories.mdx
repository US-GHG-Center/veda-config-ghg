    ### Developing Consensus Standards for Methane Plume Satellite Data
    In recent years, the urgency to address climate change has intensified, particularly concerning methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas that has significantly contributed to global warming. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has taken a proactive role in developing consensus standards to manage the growing volume of methane plume satellite data. This initiative is crucial for ensuring accurate monitoring and reporting of methane emissions, which are essential for effective climate policy and action.

    ### The Role of Satellite Observations
    Satellite observations have revolutionized the way we quantify methane emissions, allowing for measurements from global scales down to specific point sources. Instruments such as the GOSAT and TROPOMI have been pivotal in providing high-quality data that supports national inventories and compliance with international agreements like the Paris Agreement. These satellites utilize shortwave infrared (SWIR) technology to detect methane concentrations, offering near-real-time information that is critical for timely climate action.
