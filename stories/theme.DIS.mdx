    ## Info

    Hurricanes, tropical cyclones, blizzards, landslides, floods and droughts -- when they arrive in communities they can cause a disaster.
    As climate change is spurring more frequent and extreme weather events, disasters are becoming more costly and damaging.

    Earth data and rapid information sharing between agencies is more important than ever.
    Before, during and after disasters strike, federal agencies coordinate with decision-makers, providing actionable data to prepare, respond, and recover from the effects of disasters.
