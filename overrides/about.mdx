  The AIR4US is a multi-agency effort consolidating air quality data and information from observations and models and providing access to specialized tools and services to enable open access to data and visualizations.

  Scientific experts from NASA, EPA, and NOAA work together to curate the data and services ensuring decision makers and air quality managers have what they need.  

  The primary goal of the AIR4US is to make access to air quality data more efficient and easier to use for all.
