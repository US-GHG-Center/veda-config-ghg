  The  Air Quality Portal (AQ Portal) is a multi-agency effort consolidating greenhouse gas (GHG) information from observations and models. Scientific experts from NASA, EPA, NIST, and NOAA worked together to curate this catalog of GHG datasets and analysis tools. The goal is to better understand GHG fluxes and emissions from natural and human-caused sources. The US GHG Center helps researchers, climate change mitigation practitioners, policymakers, data service providers, and concerned citizens understand GHG datasets and put them to use.
  
  The initial two-year demonstration phase focused on three GHG areas of study: human-caused GHG emissions; natural GHG sources and sinks, fluxes, and patterns; and large methane emission leak events.

  The US GHG Center portal is built using open source principles and techniques allowing users to access, explore, analyze, and download data and products and learn about the latest information. It provides access to a curated and evolving list of foundational GHG data, including sources such as: ground observations from NASA, NIST, and NOAA; data collected from space-borne (ex. EMIT and OCO-2/3), airborne (ex. AVIRIS-NG), and ground-based platforms (ex. NIST tower data); and model-derived data and analyses. The US GHG Center includes curated EPA regulatory and research datasets as well as research data from NASA, NIST, and NOAA.

  The portal features stories that introduce themes, topics, data and discoveries. User support is within reach via data exploration, Jupyter notebooks, and an analysis hub for authorized users to perform advanced cloud data analysis with computational resources. All code supporting the US GHG Center system is fully open sourced and available for examination.
